OUTLINE | WIP Notes
===================

Progress:
1. Start with entering a username in Login window
    a. Message box urging player to wait 2 seconds [DONE]
        i. Popup message set up.
        ii. Set up screen to wait 1.5 seconds while it searches for peers.
        iii. System will be set to client if no other peer working as server.
        iv. Screen will move to server selection frame if there is already a server in the network.
        v. If username already exists, a warning will popup, exit login function & clear username field.
        vi. Removed multicast loop to avoid duplicate username shenanigans, but now requires at least 2 devices to test.
        vii. Fixed global variable changes not reflecting in looping thread with lock and global keyword.

CURRENTLY WORKING ON : Need proper popup when login attempted with empty username field.
======================

NEXT STEPS :
============
TCP Listener for active servers.
^ (Find out if this is possible to do only when logged in, and how to exit listener state gracefully or if SHUTDOWN is still needed) <-- iirc cannot reopen socket after closing.
Server tester to check for active servers from cache, and remove inactive ones (with lock).


Useful
======
TCP dump :
for multicast -
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -s0 -vv net 224.0.0.0/4
for all udp -
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -n udp
all UDP packets

Netcat
UDP
Listener : nc -ul 6111
Sender : nc -u <listener> 6111
then type something

Socat loopback broadcast on same system. Doesn't seem to work with 255, but can test on another system.
Send : socat - udp-sendto:127.255.255.255:3000,broadcast
Receive : socat -u udp-recv:3000,reuseaddr -
