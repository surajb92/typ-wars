OUTLINE | WIP Notes
===================

To do:
1. Go to new window
    a. Load for 3 seconds "Checking servers" (put "loading, 3,2,1 if you want"). [LATER]
        i. Popup message
        ii. 3 second wait while it searches server
        iii. Set this system to client if no other server
        iv. Move to server selection frame if there is already a server in the network
2. Figure out how networking works = Result : Too complicated to do over internet (NAT Tunneling etc.). Try with just over local network for now.
    a. Socket programming : Simple client - server connection with localhost [DONE]
    b. Send multicast to local network with server's IP. [DONE]
    c. Enable ports 3000-3100 for TCP and UDP on firewall (testing purposes, will likely finalize 3003-5 as ports to use) [DONE]

NEXT STEPS
==========
Set up server detection on main app.

Useful
======
TCP dump :
for multicast -
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -s0 -vv net 224.0.0.0/4
for all udp -
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -n udp
all UDP packets

Netcat
UDP
Listener : nc -ul 6111
Sender : nc -u <listener> 6111
then type something

Socat loopback broadcast on same system. Doesn't seem to work with 255, but can test on another system.
Send : socat - udp-sendto:127.255.255.255:3000,broadcast
Receive : socat -u udp-recv:3000,reuseaddr -
